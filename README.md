## Features

1. **Choose a Task:**
   - On startup, the application allows users to choose between three tasks:

     - Finding call numbers.
   - For now, only the "Replacing books" task is implemented.

2. **Replacing Books:**
   - When the user selects "Replacing books," the application randomly generates 10 different call numbers and displays them to the user.
   - Users can reorder the call numbers in ascending order.

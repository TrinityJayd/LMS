## Features

1. **Choose a Task:**
   - On startup, the application allows users to choose between three tasks:
     - Replacing books.
     - Identifying areas.
     - Finding call numbers.
   - For now, only the "Replacing books" task is implemented.


2. **Replacing Books:**
   - When the user selects "Replacing books," the application randomly generates 10 different call numbers and displays them to the user.
   - Users can reorder the call numbers in ascending order.
   - The application checks whether the user placed the call numbers in the correct ascending order.
   - Different levels are included to motivate users to continue learning.

### Updates Part 2
----
1. **Enabling the Identifying Areas Task**
   - In this update, the "Identifying Areas" task is enabled.

   
2. **User-Friendly Interface for Matching Columns**
   - Upon selecting the "Identifying Areas" task, users will encounter an intuitive user interface. The interface allows users to engage in a column-matching challenge involving call numbers (top level only) and descriptions.


3. **User-Driven Questions**
   - Users now have the freedom to answer as many questions as they desire.

  
4. **Alternating Question Types**
   - They alternate between matching descriptions to call numbers and call numbers to descriptions.


5. **Randomized Item Selection**
   - Each question is a unique challenge with four randomly selected items in the first column.
   - The second column presents seven potential answers, including three incorrect ones, offering a dynamic and engaging experience.

  
   **Note: In this context, a "question" encompasses the entire column-matching set, including both columns.**


6. **Gamification for User Motivation**
   - The timer and levels have been reused for gamification

  
7. **Efficient Data Storage**
   - Call numbers and their corresponding descriptions are efficiently stored in a dictionary, ensuring optimal data management and retrieval.

### Updates Part 3
----
1. **Incorporation of Finding Call Numbers Task**
    - Enabled the "Finding Call Numbers" task, allowing users to delve into the hierarchical Dewey Decimal classification system.

2. **Dynamic Quiz Structure**
    - Created a quiz mechanism where users encounter third-level entries, select from top-level options, and progress based on correct answers.

3. **Memory Loading of Dewey Decimal Data**
    - Implemented loading of Dewey Decimal classification data into application memory from a JSON file, ensuring efficient data access.

4. **Tree-Based Data Storage**
    - Utilized a tree structure to efficiently store and manage Dewey Decimal classification data within the application.
